          <p class='flow-text'>
            The "Beer Fridge of Awesomeness" is a cool project I found on
            <a class='blog-link' href='https://github.com/InitialState/beerfridge'>Github</a>
            that walks you through using a Raspberry Pi to build your very own smart beer fridge!
            The Beer Fridge can detect when it's open, measure its temperature and count the number of bottles inside.

            <h3>First Things First</h3>
            <p class='flow-text'>
              I've never used a Raspberry Pi, so first I had to get my Ultimate Starter Kit. The project has
              a pretty long list of required parts, so I had to order those as well.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class='col m6'>

        </div>
        <div class='col s12 center-align project-row white-text'>
          <h2>The Pi is Almost Done</h2>
          <img class='blog-post-pic' src='../assets/images/6272015rbpi.jpg' style='width: 50%;'>
          <p class='flow-text'>
            Installing Raspbian, the default Raspberry Pi OS was pretty simple. There's a tool called
            NOOBS,
            <small>seriously,</small>
            that pretty much does it for you.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class='col s12 center-align project-row white-text'>
          <h2>Next Steps</h2>
          <p class='flow-text'>
            The Raspberry Pi needed some way to count the number of bottles in the fridge, so I had to
            connect the Raspberry Pi, via bluetooth, to a Wii Fit Balance Board and place the fridge on top.
            Then I was able to measure the weight of the fridge.
          </p>

          <p class='flow-text'>
            The next step was to start wiring everything up.
            Some of the parts necessary for the beer fridge to be totally awesome include a temperature sensor
            and a door sensor. Getting these working with the Raspberry Pi was the most difficult part of the project,
            and required a steady hand. Below is the fully wired Pi.

          <h2>Finishing Up</h2>
          <div class='col m6'>
            <p class='flow-text'>
              All the sensors were working at this point, so it was time to fill the fridge! As I mentioned before, you should fill
              the fridge with beverages that all weigh pretty much the same. After loading up on Summer Shandy, I weighed the fridge with
              the bottles inside in order to determine each bottle's weight.

          <h2>Project Complete!</h2>
          <p class='flow-text'>
            Finally, the tutorial sets you up on a neat visualization dashboard where you can see the status of your beer fridge and monitor
            things like temperature and the number of bottles inside.

          <h2>Closing Remarks</h2>
          <p class='flow-text'>
            In the end, I thought the Beer Fridge of Awesomeness was a nice project to help me kill some time. It was my first exposure
            to working with a Raspberry Pi, and I learned a fair amount about setting up circuits and other hardware. I'm on the lookout for my next
            project!
