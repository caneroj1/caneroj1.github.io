      I've never used a Raspberry Pi before, so first I had to get my Ultimate Starter Kit. The project has a pretty long list of required parts, so I had to order those as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amongst other things, I ordered a digital thermometer and some door sensors, and the total cost for everything was around $120.

      Installing Raspbian, the default Raspberry Pi OS was pretty simple. There's a tool called
      NOOBS, that pretty much does it for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was pretty much playing the waiting game at this point.
    </p>

      The Raspberry Pi needed some way to count the number of bottles in the fridge, so I had to
      connect the Raspberry Pi, via bluetooth, to a Wii Fit Balance Board and place the fridge on top.
      Then I was able to measure the weight of the       fridge.
  </p>
  <div class="center-align">

  <p>
      The next step was to start wiring everything up.
      Some of the parts necessary for the beer fridge to be totally awesome include a temperature sensor
      and a door sensor. Getting these working with the Raspberry Pi was the most difficult part of the project,
      and required a steady hand. Below is the fully wired Pi.

    <p>
      All the sensors were working at this point, so it was time to fill the fridge! As I mentioned before, you should fill
      the fridge with beverages that all weigh pretty much the same. After loading up on Summer Shandy, I weighed the fridge with
      the bottles inside in order to determine each bottle's weight.

      Finally, the tutorial sets you up on a neat visualization dashboard where you can see the status of your beer fridge and monitor
      things like temperature and the number of bottles inside.

  <p>
      In the end, I thought the Beer Fridge of Awesomeness was a nice project to help me kill some time. It was my first exposure
      to working with a Raspberry Pi, and I learned a fair amount about setting up circuits and other hardware. I'm on the lookout for my next
      project!
