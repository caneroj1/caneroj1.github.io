              Musicians Wanted is an iOS app written for finding local musicians and promoting events.
              The app was designed and implemented during TCNJ's Spring 2015 Cloud Computing class. The application uses
              Amazon Web Services for its infrastructure, specifically S3, RDS, among others.

              %h4 MW API
            %p
              The iOS app leverages a Ruby on Rails API to handle backend transactions, like
              user authentication, account management, posting of events, and other actions. The API uses
              postgreSQL as its DB and is hosted on a Linode VM.
