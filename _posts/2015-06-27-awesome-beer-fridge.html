  The "Beer Fridge of Awesomeness" is a cool project I found on <a href="https://github.com/InitialState/beerfridge">Github</a>
  that walks you through using a Raspberry Pi to build your very own smart beer fridge!
  The Beer Fridge can detect when it's open, measure its temperature and count the number of bottles inside.

      I've never used a Raspberry Pi before, so first I had to get my Ultimate Starter Kit. The project has a pretty long list of required parts, so I had to order those as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amongst other things, I ordered a digital thermometer and some door sensors, and the total cost for everything was around $120.

      Installing Raspbian, the default Raspberry Pi OS was pretty simple. There's a tool called
      NOOBS, that pretty much does it for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was pretty much playing the waiting game at this point.

      The Raspberry Pi needed some way to count the number of bottles in the fridge, so I had to
      connect the Raspberry Pi, via bluetooth, to a Wii Fit Balance Board and place the fridge on top.
      Then I was able to measure the weight of the       fridge.

      The next step was to start wiring everything up.
      Some of the parts necessary for the beer fridge to be totally awesome include a temperature sensor
      and a door sensor. Getting these working with the Raspberry Pi was the most difficult part of the project,
      and required a steady hand. Below is the fully wired Pi.

      All the sensors were working at this point, so it was time to fill the fridge! As I mentioned before, you should fill
      the fridge with beverages that all weigh pretty much the same. After loading up on Summer Shandy, I weighed the fridge with
      the bottles inside in order to determine each bottle's weight.

      Finally, the tutorial sets you up on a neat visualization dashboard where you can see the status of your beer fridge and monitor
      things like temperature and the number of bottles inside.

      In the end, I thought the Beer Fridge of Awesomeness was a nice project to help me kill some time. It was my first exposure
      to working with a Raspberry Pi, and I learned a fair amount about setting up circuits and other hardware. I'm on the lookout for my next
      project!
