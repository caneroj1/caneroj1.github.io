Working with a database is often an integral part of developing software, and so it is important to understand the language of databases just as you would understand Ruby or C++.

      A database is just an organized collection of data used for
      many different purposes, such as storing information for analysis or maintaining records of purchases.
      The most popular databases today are <strong>relational</strong> databases, which means that there are
      <strong>relationships</strong> between the data stored in the database. Let's use Amazon for an example. When one purchases
      goods from Amazon, those transactions are added to your list of past orders. Basically, a single customer can <strong>have
      many</strong> orders. There! We just defined a relationship, a <strong>one-to-many</strong> relationship..
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's think about another kind of relationship. We all know that items that you see on Amazon often belong to categories. For example,
      a gaming console could belong to an electronics category, as well as a gaming one. But each category can also have many items within it.
      This leads to another kind of relationship, called a <strong>many-to-many</strong> relationship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that we have a basic understanding of what databases are, let's move on to the main topic: joins!

      Before we can start doing any SQL, let's first create our table. I like Game of Thrones, so that's the theme of this post's SQL. It's important to note that
      I'm also using postgreSQL in all of the examples.
      {% highlight sql %}
      CREATE TABLE houses (
        id serial PRIMARY KEY,
        title varchar(255)
      );

      CREATE TABLE characters (
        id serial PRIMARY KEY,
        name varchar(255),
        house_id INTEGER REFERENCES houses (id)
      );
      {% endhighlight %}
      This makes two tables, one called <strong>houses</strong> and the other called <strong>characters</strong>. Their attributes
      are pretty simple, but it's important to note that the characters table has a foreign key reference to houses, meaning that each character's
      house_id maps up to an entry in the houses table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now let's add some fake data in there.
      {% highlight sql %}
      INSERT INTO houses (title)
      VALUES
      ('Targaryen'),
      ('Lannister'),
      ('Stark');

      INSERT INTO characters (name, house_id)
      VALUES
      ('Aegon Targaryen', 1),
      ('Daenerys Targaryen', 1),
      ('Jaime Lannister', 2),
      ('Eddard Stark', 3),
      ('Lyanna Stark', 3);
      {% endhighlight %}

      Cool.

      There are a few different kinds of joins in standard SQL. These include:
      <ul>
        <li>Natural Join</li>
        <li>Inner Join</li>
        <li>Left Outer Join</li>
        <li>Right Outer Join</li>
        <li>Full Outer Join</li>
      </ul>
      Each join has its own tradeoffs and advantages, which we'll cover in turn. First up...
